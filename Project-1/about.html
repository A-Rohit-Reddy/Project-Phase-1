            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <p>
                Hey, myself Rohit Reddy A. I am a first-year B.Tech undergrad student pursuing Computer Science in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I know intermediate-level coding in Python and C, though my preferred language is Python.
                <br><br>
                My hobbies are playing cricket, drawing, and nature photography. I plan to further develop my skills in photography at a later stage. I have had a special interest in mathematics since childhood, and it has been my strongest subject from my schooling till now.
                <br><br>
                I love to explain things and solve problems that others find difficult, as I feel it as a challenge and that motivates me a lot.

            <h1>Further Interests and Plans</h1>
            <p>
                I am interested in mathematics and coding, which has been my main reason for taking up Computer Science. I also aim to develop myself in photography and improve my cricketing skills, bowling in particular.
                <br><br>
                I'm curious about the vast possibilities in the field of computing and want to find my niche within it. I'm passionate about joining clubs, and that was one of the main reasons I chose CSE at Amrita, Amritapuri.
                <br><br>
                I also plan on learning more programming languages and exploring the various skills coding has to offer.
