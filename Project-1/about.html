    <div class="myInfo">
        <p>Hey, myself Rohit Reddy A. I am a first year B-tech undergrad student pursuing computer science in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I know intermediate level coding in Python and C , though my preferred language is Python. My hobbies are playing cricket , drawing and nature photography. I plan to further develop my skills in photography at a later stage. I have had a special interest in mathematics since childhood , and it has been my strongest subject from my schooling till now. I love to explain things, and solve problems which others find difficult, as I feel it as a challenge and that motivates me a lot.</p>
